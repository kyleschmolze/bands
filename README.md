# Bands
Let's keep track of our favorite bands with a helpful Ruby `Band` class!

Our `Band` class lives in `band.rb`. Our tests live in `spec/band_spec.rb`.
Run the tests by simply entering `rspec` on the command line.
You should have 1 passing test, and 2 failing tests.

**Step 0:** Jump into a ruby console by typing the `pry` command in the terminal. First you'll need to require the `band.rb` file with `require './band'`. Then try messing around with the `Band` class: 
```
b = Band.new
b.name = "The Beatles"
b.name # "The Beatles"
b.members #...
```

**Step 1:** Fix the second test so it passes by adding Ringo to the band. Can you think of more than one way to do this?

**Step 2:** Define the `:capitalized_members` method in `band.rb` so that the relevant test passes.

**Step 3:** Use the public API from TheAudioDB.com to lookup the list of albums for any given band!

First, review the documentation on [TheAudioDB.com's API here](https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php).
We'll be using the `discography.php` endpoint.
Here's an example GET request you can send to this endpoint (just paste this into your browser):

```
https://theaudiodb.com/api/v1/json/2/discography.php?s=the%20beatles
```

To make an API request in Ruby, you can either use the (kind of confusing) built in Ruby methods (`Net::HTTP`), or you can use a more developer-friendly library like [HTTParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty)! Let's do that :)

1. Review the HTTParty README.
2. Install HTTParty with `gem install httparty`.
3. Add `require 'httparty'` to the top of `band.rb`.
4. Write a new `:albums` method for `band.rb`, which makes the API call using HTTParty and returns this list of albums.

**Bonus:** Instead of returning the exact API response from TheAudioDB (with album names and the year they were released), manipulate your response first so that the `:albums` method only returns an array of the titles of the albums only.

**Double bonus:** What happens if the band name is total jibberish (e.g. "jifes93svidl")? Can your method return some intelligent response when the API call "fails"?

**Triple bonus:** Add two optional arguments to `:albums` which allow you to specify a starting year and/or an ending year. Only return the titles of albums which were published in that year.

**Home run:** Write a test or two for the `:albums` method.
