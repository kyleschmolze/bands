# Bands
Let's keep track of our favorite bands with a helpful Ruby `Band` class!

Our `Band` class lives in `band.rb`. Our tests live in `spec/band_spec.rb`.
Run the tests by simply entering `rspec` on the command line.
You should have 1 passing test, and 3 failing tests.

Step 1: Fix the second test so it passes by adding Ringo to the band. Can you think of more than one way to do this?

Step 2: Define the `:capitalized_members` method in `band.rb` so that the relevant test passes.

Step 3: Add a new `:youtube_url` method to `band.rb` so that the relevant test passes.
